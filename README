Installing:

```
git clone https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit.git
```

Probably won't keep using nanojit, but if so, here's some steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/doublec/nanojit-central.git
cd nanojit-central
autoconf
./configure
make
```

I did have to mess with the build here a bit: I removed -Wall from the resulting build file and had to add a pragma in clang to ignore NULL checks on the this pointer.
